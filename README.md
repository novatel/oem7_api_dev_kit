    <h3>OEM7 auth-code Requirements</h3>
    <p>
    Use of the OEM7 API requires your NovAtel receiver is configured with an API-ready <a href="https://docs.novatel.com/OEM7/Content/Firmware_Update/Upgrading_Using_the_AUTH.htm">authorization code</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    To check if your OEM7 receiver is authorized for API use, you can use the <a href="https://docs.novatel.com/OEM7/Content/Logs/MODELFEATURES.htm">MODELFEATURES</a> log, as follows:
    
`LOG MODELFEATURES`
    </p>
    <p>
    If your receiver is not authorized for the API, you may contact NovAtel Applications Engineering to acquire a temporary trial auth-code.
